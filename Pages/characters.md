# Characters

## Portraits

I've found the following prompt to be a reliable way to get an attractive portrait of a character:

- `#{image}, portrait, dnd #{race}, #{physical features}, painterly, #{atmosphere}, character art, #{color}`

The order of the words matters and the sequence above is  

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th colspan="3">`#{image} portrait, dnd #{race}, painterly, character art`</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2">Genasi</td>
    <td>No image</td>
    <td>``</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Image</td>
    <td>Image</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
